# HELLO EVERYONE THIS IS ONE OF THE FAMOUS QUESTIONS OF LISTS IN PYTHON:

# QUESTION : Write the program that prompts the user for a list of
# numbers and prints out the maximum and minimum of the numbers at
# the end when the user enters “done”. Write the program to store the
# numbers the user enters in a list and use the max() and min() functions to
# compute the maximum and minimum numbers after the loop completes.

# ANSWER:  

print('When you are all done type "done".')
lst=[]
while True:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done":
        break
    try:
        num=int(num)
    except:
        print('Invalid number!')
        continue
    lst.append(num)

print(lst)
print('Max:',max(lst))
print('Min:',min(lst))

# Hope you get help from this code :)
